As an applied statistician, my work mixes methodological development,
software development, and data analysis. By methodological development
I mean try to re-use or combine existing existing statistical results
to solve a statistical issue. So far, I have organized my research
around three topics:
- the development of **latent variable models** for the analysis of
  complex systems. I apply these developments on neuroimaging data and
  data from psychological tests to investigate the relationship
  between the brain response and depression.

- the analysis of registry data with **time to events outcomes** and
  **competing risks**. My developments have,
  for instance, been applied to compare preventive stroke treatments
  using the danish registry data.

- the development of **generalized pairwise comparisons** to handle
  multiple and heterogenous outcomes. A typical
  application is the assessment of new chemotherapy where being able
  to balance the benefit (longer in survival time) and the risk
  (treatment side effects) in an interpretable way is important.

I have implemented these developments in the R packages
[lavaSearch2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaSearch2/index.html),
[riskRegression](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/riskRegression/index.html),
and
[BuyseTest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BuyseTest/index.html).

I have been also been reading about:
- **causal inference** with *Causality: Models, Reasoning and
  Inference* (Pearl, 2013) and *Causal Inference in Statistics - A Primer* (Pearl, 2016).
- **semi parametric theory** with *Semiparametric Theory and Missing
  Data* (Tsiatis, 2006)
- **post-selection inference** with mostly papers like *Exact
  post-selection inference, with application to the lasso* (Lee et
  al., 2016) or *Optimal Inference After Model Selection* (Fithian et
  al., 2014)
- **GAM** with the excellent book *Generalized Additive Models: An
  Introduction with R* (Wood 2017)
