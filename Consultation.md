title:  "Statistical consultations at NRU"
categories: jekyll update
---

This page is meant for the NRU staff
 ([https://nru.dk/](https://nru.dk/)) needing assistance with data
 analysis. You will find information about the statistical support
 that I provide at NRU, how to get help and what to expect. People
 outside NRU but working at Rigshospitalet should contact the
 "statistical advisory service at Rigshospitalet", see the link at the
 end of the page.


## What can I help you with?

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis**: <br> You would
like to perform a statistical analysis but would like a statistician
to supervise your work. It could also be that you would like to
perform a specific type of analysis (e.g. replicating what another
article previously did) but you need some help to carry it out.

- **Technical questions**: <br> You have a specific question, it
  could be a software question, e.g.  _which package to use in R for
  fitting a linear mixed model?_ or a statistical question, e.g.  _I
  would like to compare the mean recovery across three treatment
  groups, do you know a statistical test for doing that?_ <br> An
  example of non-specific question is: _Can you check that my
  statistical analysis is correct_ (this is not specific because there
  are many probably things to check).  A more appropriate question for
  this format would be: _Looking at the qqplot of the residuals of my
  model, do you think the normality assumption is reasonable?_

- **Planning a study**: <br> You are planning a new study or
experiment. You have one or few clearly defined hypotheses that you
would like to test but you are wondering how to appropriately design
your experiment / study to be able to carry out the tests. This is not
my domain of expertise in statistics but I can give you some feedback
and help you with simple power calculation. However do NOT come the
day before your grant deadline asking me for an "emergency" power
calculation!

- **Externalizing the statistical analysis**: <br> You want a
statistician to perform the statistical analysis for you. Don't expect
much from me in this case, I will rarely accept to perform the
statistical analysis myself (this is at my discretion).

![](https://bozenne.github.io/img/warning.jpeg){:height="50px"
width="50px"} I cannot helping you with "Making sure my analysis is
correct": this is typically a too broad and unspecific question. It
would be like going to the doctor and ask him whether he can check
that you are heatlhy.

## How to get help?

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis/Planning a
study**: <br> You should send me an email (<brice.ozenne@nru.dk>, please
put **Consultation** in the subject line). The email should include:
  + a name for your project
  + a short description of your study and your questions. By short I
    mean it can be just a few sentences.    
  + [optional] additional documents with a sentence explaining at
which part of the document I should look at (especially for articles).
e.g. _a display of the design of the study_ <br> or _the article of a
study that you would like to replicate_.
  <br> <br>

  Then you can book an appointment (1/2 hour to 1 hour) in my calendar
  during my consultation hours. I only take one or two consultations
  like that a week so I may ask you to postpone the meeting if I am
  too busy.
  
  Note: sending me information by email may seem a loss of time, but
  it will help me prepare the consultation and so we will be more
  efficient when we will meet. In some cases it also forces you to
  write down clearly what you are actually doing / wanting to do and
  you may yourself find the answers to your questions!

- **Technical questions**: <br> You don’t need to book a meeting, you
  can just show at my office during my consultation hours. Just check
  in my calendar (in [cal](https://cal.nru.dk/)) that I don't already
  have a meeting. This type of consultation is typically short,
  i.e. less than 15 minutes. If I am busy, you can also send me an
  email (<brice.ozenne@nru.dk>, please put **Consultation** in the
  subject line) explaining your problem and I will try to answer
  within a week.

## When can you get help? Consultation hours
I take consultations *Tuesday afternoon* (13h30-17h30). <br>
 
If this is completely incompatible with your schedule, for instance
because you're running weekly experiments those days, just ask me and
we will figure out a solution.

## Authorship

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis**: This help
  qualifies me for co-authorship. I expect it to be automatic. If
  you/your superviser disagree we should discuss it at the first
  meeting. My affiliations are:
  + Department of Public Health, Section of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen, 5 Øster Farimagsgade, 1014 Copenhagen, Denmark
  + Neurobiology Research Unit and BrainDrugs, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, 6-8 Inge Lehmanns Vej, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark  <br> <br>
		  
- **Externalizing the statistical analysis**: This help qualifies me
  for co-authorship. I expect it to be automatic and I will also
  expect to have a good place (e.g. second, third, second to last).

- **Technical questions**: This help does not qualify me for co-authorship. 

- **Planning a study**: This help does not qualify me for co-authorship. 

## Response time 

I usually answer to 'simple' questions that I could not solve during
the consultation within a week. If you haven't heard from me within a
week, please send me a reminder, I have probably forgotten (sorry!).

If you ask me to review your article you should give me at least two
weeks.

What I cannot do is to help you to finish your analysis for
tomorrow. Please anticipate a resonable time for the statistical
analysis, especially if you have a complicated design or many
hypotheses to test.

## Software

I can provide you with support using [R](https://www.r-project.org/),
e.g. find the appropriate function(s) to perform your analysis,
display the results, and understand the outputs from the software.

For other softwares (e.g. SAS, Stata, SPSS, GraphPad Prism, MATLAB,
Python, ...), I can try to help you to understand the outputs from the
software. Note that there are very skilled people using SAS at the section
of biostatistics so you should consider using Statistical advisory
service at Rigshospitalet (below) if you want to use SAS but you
anticipate you will need help in using it. People from the data analysis
group at NRU tend to use MATLAB and many psychologists at NRU use SPSS
so they can probably help you with these software.

## Confidentiality

Please tell me if there is any confidentiality clause relative to your
results or your data. By default, I will not share your data with
anybody without asking you. However I may discuss the analysis with
people at the section of biostatistics (not the results just the
method).

## What to expect?

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis** <br>
  I can help you with:
  + performing statistical analysis that are suited to your research
    question and that output interpretable results.
  + generating nice figures (if you use the R software).
  + writing the "statistical analysis" paragraph from the method
    section and presenting the results in your manuscript.
  + making sure that your analysis is reproducible, i.e. when you get
    the review 3 months after you are able to reproduce the results
    you got when you wrote the article (you need to ask specifically
    for this).
  + answering the comments of the reviewers that are related to the
    statistical analysis.

  This typically involves:
  - starting from a research question, e.g. is treatment A better than treatment B?
  - defining parameter(s) of interest that can be used to answer the research question,
  e.g. difference in mean outcome under treatment A vs. under treatment B. Often several parameter(s) of interest are possible,
  e.g. median outcome or frequency of a higher outcome under A vs. B, and which one to choose should mainly depend on the clinical or biological relevance.
  - identifying complications like confounding, missing values, ...
  - deciding on a model to estimate the parameters of interest despite the complications, e.g. a linear model adjusted for age, and expliciting the assumptions, e.g. linear age effect, no other confounder, ...
  - deciding on an appropriate testing procedure, e.g. Wald test, possible adjustment for multiple comparisons.
  The definition of parameter of the interest is critical: it is not possible to evaluate the quality of a statistical analysis if we cannot explicit what we want to estimate. 
  <br> <br>

- **Technical questions**: <br> I will try my best to indicate the
  appropriate software/package/function/statistical tool/criteria to
  use for solving your problem. I will though only try to answer what
  you asked for. So I will assume that you have given me all the
  necessary information and if information is missing I will assume
  that you are in a standard case (e.g. normally distributed outcomes,
  no missing values, …). In particular, I will (try to) not assess
  whether what you have been doing seems reasonable to me and I am not
  responsible for the validity of the statistical analysis.

## What I will expect from you

- *to present me the person(s) involved in the project*, especially
  for students it is nice for me to know who is your supervisor. By
  default I will assume that you are the person in charge of the
  project. Also tell me if there is another statistician involved
  because it makes sense that the statisticians agree before telling
  you what to do.
  
- *to be responsible for organizing meetings*, their frequency, and
  choosing who should attend the meetings. Importantly, outside the
  meeting I will never check whether you are making progress or need
  help. So when you meet technical issues (with the software or what
  the statistical method is about) it is often a good idea to look for
  information on Internet and then to reach for help (me or one of
  your colleagues).

- *to keep track of the decision(s)* we have taken during the
  meeting. When the decisions are related to the manuscript you should
  also write down the reason(s) for these decisions. It can seem
  annoying to do but this will help us a lot first and foremost
  because I will forget what has happened at the last meeting. It will
  also help me to be consistent over time.

- *to have a somewhat clear and fixed aim*. If you have changed your
  research question between two meetings you should explain it to
  me. You can ask the same from me if I decide to change the
  statistical approach.

- *to be open-minded and willing to implement recommandations*. But
   you should have time and willingness to give an honest try to what
   I recommend to you. You are obviously welcome to disagree with me,
   suggest classical approaches used in your field, and mention
   practical constrains (time, programming skills). 
  
- *before submitting an article* with my name on, you need to *have*
  had *my approval*. Send me your article and I will give you some
  comments. If I mention "major" or "major concerns" or something
  along those lines this means that we need one more iteration (send
  article, comments) before I approve it. Note that you're very
  welcome to disagree with my comments, then we should just meet to
  discuss them. <br> <br>
