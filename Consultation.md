This page is meant for the NRU staff
 ([https://nru.dk/](http://example.com/)) needing assistance with data
 analysis. I do NOT help people outside NRU.


## What can I help you with?

- **Technical questions**: <br> You have a very specific question, it
  could be a software question, e.g.  _which package to use in R for
  fitting a linear mixed model?_ or a statistical question, e.g.  _I
  would like to compare the mean recovery across three treatment
  groups, do you know a statistical test for doing that?_ <br> An
  example of non-specific question is: _Can you check that my
  statistical analysis is correct_ (this is not specific because there
  are many probably things to check).  A more appropriate question for
  this format would be: _Looking at the qqplot of the residuals of my
  model, do you think the normality assumption is reasonable?_

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis**: <br> You would
like to perform a statistical analysis but would like a statistician
to supervise your work. It could also be that you would like to
perform a specific type of analysis (e.g. replicating what another
article previously did) but you need some help to carry it out.

- **Planning a study**: <br> You are planning a new study or
experiment. You have one or few clearly defined hypotheses that you
would like to test but you are wondering how to appropriately design
your experiment / study to be able to carry out the tests. This is not
my domain of expertise in statistics but I can give you some feedback
and help you with simple power calculation. However do NOT come the
day before your grant deadline asking me for an "emergency" power
calculation!

- **Externalizing the statistical analysis**: <br> You want a
statistician to perform the statistical analysis for you. Don't expect
much from me in this case, I will rarely accept to perform the
statistical analysis myself (this is at my discretion). If I accept
this would be because the statistical issues met in your study are
related to my research interests, nothing else. 

## How to get help?

- **Technical questions**: <br> You don’t need to book a meeting, you
  can just show at my office during my consultation hours. Just check
  in my calendar (in [cal](https://cal.nru.dk/)) that I don't already
  have a meeting. This type of consultation is typically short,
  i.e. less than 15 minutes. If I am busy, you can also send me an
  email (<brice.ozenne@nru.dk>, please put **Consultation** in the
  subject line) explaining your problem and I will try to answer
  within a week.

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis/Planning a
study**: <br> You should send me an email (<brice.ozenne@nru.dk>, please
put **Consultation** in the subject line). The email should include:
  + a name for your project
  + a short description of your study and your questions. By short I
    mean it can be just two sentences.    
  + [optional] additional documents with a sentence explaining at
which part of the document I should look at (especially for articles).
e.g. _a display of the design of the study_ <br> or _the article of a
study that you would like to replicate_.
  <br> <br>

  Then you can book an appointment (1/2 hour to 1 hour) in my calendar
  during my consultation hours. I only take one or two consultations
  like that a week so I may ask you to postpone the meeting if I am
  too busy.
  
  Note: sending me information by email may seem a loss of time, but
  it will help me prepare the consultation and so we will be more
  efficient when we will meet. In some cases it also forces you to
  write down clearly what you are actually doing / wanting to do and
  you may find by yourself the answers to your questions!

## When can you get help ? Consultation hours
I take consultations Monday afternoon (13h30-17h30) and Tuesday
afternoon (13h30-17h30). <br>

If this is completely incompatible with your schedule, for instance
because you're running every week experiments those days, just ask me
we will figure out a solution.

## What to expect?

- **Technical questions**: <br> I will try my best to indicate the
  appropriate the appropriate software/package/function/statistical
  tool/criteria to use for solving your problem. Here I only try to
  answer what you asked for. So I will assume that you have given me
  all the necessary information and if information is missing I will
  assume that you are in a standard case (e.g. normally distributed
  outcomes, no missing values, …). In particular, I will (try to) not
  assess whether what your doing seems reasonable to me and I am not
  responsible for the validity of the statistical analysis.

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis** <br>
  I can help you with:
  + performing statistical analysis that are suited to your research
    question and that output interpretable quantities.
  + generating nice figures (if you use the R software).
  + writing the "statistical analysis" paragraph from the method
    section and presenting the results in your manuscript.
  + making sure that your analysis is reproducible, i.e. when you get
    the review 3 months after you are able to reproduce the results
    you got when you wrote the article (you need to ask specifically
    for this).
  + answering the comments of the reviewers that are related to the
    statistical analysis.  <br> <br>

  What I will expect from you:
  + to present me the person(s) involved in the project. By default I
  will assume that you are the person in charge of the project. Also
  tell me if there is another statistician involve because it make
  sense that the statisticians agree before telling you what to do.
  + to be responsible for organizing meeting, their frequency, and
  choosing who should attend the meetings. Importantly, outside the
  meeting I will never check whether you are making progress or need
  help. So when you meet technical issues (with the software or what
  the statistical method is about) it is often a good idea to look for
  information on Internet and then to reach for help (me or one of
  your colleague).
  + to have a somewhat clear and fixed aim. If you have changed your
  research question between two meetings you should explain it to
  me. You can ask the same from me if I decide to change the
  statistical approach.
  + to keep track of the decision(s) we have taken during the
  meeting. When the decisions are related to the manuscript you should
  also write down the reason(s) for these decisions. It can seem
  annoying to do but this will help us a lot first and foremost
  because I will forget what has happened at the last meeting. It will
  also help me to be consistent over time.
  + to follow my recommendations: you are also welcome to disagree and
  to propose alternative approach, for instance because they are more
  classical in your fields. But at the end either we find an agreement
  or I may withdraw from the project. If it was the case, it only
  means that I don't feel comfortable taking the responsibility for a
  statistical analysis I disapprove, nothing more.
  + before submitting an article with my name on it, you need to have
  had my approval. Send me your article and I will give you some
  comments. If I mention "major" or "major concerns" or something
  along those lines this means that we need one more iteration (send
  article, comments) before I approve it. Note that you're very
  welcome to disagree with my comments, then we should just meet to
  discuss them. <br> <br>

 <!-- You should not expect me: -->
 <!-- + to be a policeman: you should not try things and then come to me -->
 <!-- asking whether it correct or not. -->
 <!-- + to be a magician: you should not expect statistics to create data -->
 <!-- or more information than you have. If you only have data on 20 -->
 <!-- subjects don't aim at testing 100 null hypotheses. Also be -->
 <!-- realistic: doing statistics is not easy especially when it is not -->
 <!-- your field of expertise. If you come with a complicated design, -->
 <!-- missing values, and outcomes with non standard distributions, it -->
 <!-- becomes less likely that (i) I can propose a statistical method -->
 <!-- suited to your needs, (ii) this method is easy to apply, (iii) this -->
 <!-- method is easy to interpret, (iv) it is the classical method used in -->
 <!-- your field. -->
 <!-- + to be a software tester: if you try to do the same analysis in -->
 <!-- several software, you may end-up with different results. This is -->
 <!-- annoying but you should not expect me to be able to say which -->
 <!-- software is the best. I am personally working with the R software, -->
 <!-- but I trust the classical software, e.g. SAS, SPSS, matlab .... -->
 <!-- + to know all the statistical methods: sadly I have a limited -->
 <!-- knowledge. So if you need to use a method with which I am not -->
 <!-- familiar may need additional time to be able to help you. -->



## Authorship

- **Technical questions**: This help does not qualify me for co-authorship. 

- **Assistance for performing a statistical analysis**: This help
  qualifies me for co-authorship. I expect it to be automatic. If
  you/your superviser disagree we should discuss it at the first
  meeting. My affiliations are:
  + Neurobiology Research Unit, Rigshospitalet and University of
    Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark
  + Department of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen,
  Denmark  <br> <br>
  
- **Planning a study**: This help does not qualify me for co-authorship. 

## Response time 

I usually answer to questions that I could not solve during the
consultation within a week. I you havn't heared from after a week,
please send me a reminder, I have probably forgotten (sorry!).

If you ask me to review your article you should give me a delay of
two weeks.

What I cannot do is to help you to finish your analysis for
tomorrow. Please anticipate a resonable time for the statistical
analysis, especially if you have a complicated design or many
hypotheses to test.

## Software

I can provide you support in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to find
the appropriate function(s) to perform your analysis, display the
results, and understand the outputs of the software.

For other softwares (e.g. SAS, Stata, SPSS, GraphPad Prism, MATLAB,
Python, ...), I can try to help you to understand the outputs of
software. Note that they are very skilled people in SAS at the section
of biostatistics so you should consider using Statistical advisory
service at Rigshospitalet (below) if you want to use SAS but you
anticipate you will need help to use it. People from the data analysis
group at NRU tend to use MATLAB and many psychologists at NRU use SPSS
so they can probably help you with these software.

## Confidentiality

Please tell me if there is any confidentiality clause relative to your
results or your data. By default, I will not share your data with
anybody without asking you. However I may discuss the analysis with
people at the section of biostatistics (not the results just the
method).
