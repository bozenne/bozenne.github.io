# NEUROMODEL project

I am the happy beneficiary of an EU grant Marie Sklodowska-Curie
Individual Fellowship (MSCA-IF) for the period june 2017 -
june 2019. The project aims to meet the need in neuroscience for
flexible statistical tools able to jointly analyse clinical, genetic,
psychological and imaging data by adapting a class of statistical
models, latent variable models (LVMs), to the specificities of
neuroscience data.

LVMs is a tool of choice for studying systems of variables and in
particular when considering noisy or indirect measurements of the
quantity of interest. This is typically the case when studying
depression: we cannot directly measure it but we can observe its
effect on memory, reaction time, ... . LVMs define unobserved
variables such as depression as latent variables and attempt to
identify them using the observed data and the modeling assumptions.

The project aims at adapting LVMs to the context of neuroscience. This
is a particular challenging field because studies have often a very
limited number of participants (typically less than 100) and involve
many variables with intricated correlation structures. The project is
divided in three work packages (WPs), the first two focus on
statistical/software developments and the third on dissemination and
application in neuroscience.

## Work package 1: regularized LVMs

consists in the development of LVMs for high-dimensional data
  using regularization terms. As often in statistics, LVMs provides
  correct answers when they are correctly specified, i.e. we correctly
  model the relationship between variables. However a correct
  specification require usually more background knowledge than
  available. We therefore often rely on data-driven procedure to check
  whether the proposed model
