## How to generate the website (locally)

- *template*: `jekyll new blog`
- *compile site*: `jekyll serve` (need to be in the directory of the website, e.g. using `cd blog`)

## Thanks

To [github](https://github.com/about)
and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to enable me to create a website
without worrying about html code or learning how to deploy my
site. 

To my brother for showing me how to use them!
