[The
document](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/2024_10_10-random-intercept/post-random-intercept.pdf)
derive a close-form formula for the standard error of a treatment
effect estimate in a random intercept model applied on a balanced
design. It is related to other approaches based on a t-test. Finally
simulation studies are used to illustrate the lack of type 1 error
control when the data-generating correlation matrix deviate from a
compound symmetry structure.
