See
[here](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/2020_12_06-efficientBaselineAdjustment/post-efficientBaselineAdjustment.pdf)
for the derivation of a robust and efficient estimator for comparing
two proportions using baseline covariates. The estimator exploits the
randomness of the group allocation to ensure robustness to a possible
mispecification of the effect of the baseline variables.
