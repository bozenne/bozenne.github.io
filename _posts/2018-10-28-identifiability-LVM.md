When using the lava package, sometimes the estimation procedure fails
to converge. Often this is because the model is not identifiable and
it is therefore estimation is just not possible (in a unique way). In
such a case the practionner should modify his/her model to make it
identifiable or collect additional data. This
[document](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Identifiability-LVM/LVMindentifiability.pdf)
describe a simple procedure to derive necessary identifiability
conditions for a latent variable model.
