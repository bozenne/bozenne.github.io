[The
document](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/2022_07_08-partial-correlation/post-partial-correlation.pdf)
present how to extract from a (univariate) linear regression model
partial correlation coefficients. It also precise what type of
"partial" (i.e. adjusted on which covariate) we get. When having
multiple measurements of pairs of variables, various technics to
estimate (partial) correlations are being compared.
