Dear participants

Welcome to the tutorial "Analysis of repeated measurements with mixed models using the R package LMMstar" that will take place Tuesday 7th of June between 13.30 and 16.30 (Petren).

The tutorial is divided into 3 parts:
- general introduction to linear mixed models
- analysis of baseline follow-up studies
- advanced topics (optimization, statistical inference, prediction) 
Each part include a short presentation of the theoretical background, introduction to the software interface, and exercises.

You will find in attached to this email the course material
- .pdf for the slides
- .R for the code used to solve the exercises

To be able to run the code and solve the exercises, you will need:
- a fairly recent version of R (>4.0.0, https://cloud.r-project.org/)
- a nice user interface to R (e.g. R studio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- the latest version of the following packages installed: LMMstar, lava, ggplot2, qqtest, multcomp, psych, lattice, optimx.
  To do so, you can open an R session and run:
install.packages(c("LMMstar", "lava", "ggplot2", "qqtest", "multcomp", "psych", "lattice", "optimx"))

Looking forward to see you on Tuesday,
Brice and Julie
