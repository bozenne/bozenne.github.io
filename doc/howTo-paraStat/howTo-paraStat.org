* Descriptive

"Characteristics of the study population were presented as count ..."
"P-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant"
# @@latex:any arbitrary LaTeX code@@

* Regression
"Residuals were visually inspected for normality"

"The addition of model paths was considered iteratively, based on Score
tests of improvement in model fit with a false-discovery rate of 0.05
(Benjaminiâ€“Hochbergfalse-discovery rate-corrected) across all possible
paths.

"Cox regression was performed to model effects of YYY on the
outcome-specific hazard rates. In all Cox regression analyses the
baseline hazard function was stratified by XXX".

* ATE

[long]
"The instantaneous risk of each event (XXX and death) were modeled
using cause-specific Cox regression where the aforementioned
covariates were used as repressors and using a treatment-specific
baseline hazard function. For each treatment modality, the
patient-specific absolute risk of an event was then computed as the
instantaneous risk of this event times its probability of being
event-free, cumulated over time. The standardized absolute risk was
then obtained by averaging the patient-specific risks for each
treatment modality over the whole cohort. Difference in standardized
risks can be attributed to the treatment effect under certain
assumptions [REF. section 13.5 in the book Causal inference what if by
Hernan and Robin], including no missing confounder in the
cause-specific Cox regressions."

[short]
 "Average treatment effects were reported as differences of the
absolute risks standardized to each of the treatments (g-formula)"

"... if assumptions met ..., the average treatment effects can be
interpreted as what one would have observed in arandomized clinical
trial."

* Mixed model
Changes in bodyweight over time were analyzed using a linear mixed
model which included follow-up time (categorical) as fixed effect and
which further assumed an unstructured covariance pattern to account
for repleated measurements on the same subjects.

* Review
