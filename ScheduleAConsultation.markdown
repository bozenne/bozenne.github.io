I distinguish four types of consultations:

# Technical questions 

You have a **specific software/statistical question**, <br>
e.g. *which package to use in R for fitting a linear mixed model* <br>
or *the referee asked me to use a non-parametric test instead of a t.test. Do you know such a test?*.

You don't need to book a meeting, you can just show at my office
Monday afternoon (14h-17h) or Tuesday afternoon (14h-17h). <br> You can
also send me an email explaining your problem (please put **Consultation**
in the subject line).

This type of consultation should last less than 15 minutes. <br> In
some cases the question can seem simple to you but is difficult for me
to answer, either because it is a difficult question from the
statistical point of view or I don't have much expertise in the field
you are asking for. Don't worry I will do some bibliographic research
and let you know latter.

This type of consultation is refered as a Minor consultation in the
[Guidelines for access to assistance with data analysis at
NRU](jekyll/update/2017/06/23/GuidelineConsultNRU.html).

# Assistance for performing a statistical analysis

You have collected some data and you would like some advice about how to
analyze them. Or you have already performed the analysis but you are in doubt about
what you did. 

You should send me an email (brice.ozenne@nru.dk, please put **Consultation** in the subject line) with:
- a name for your project
- a short description of your study and your problem. 
- [optional] additional documents with a sentence explaining at which part of the
document I should look at (especially for articles). <br>
e.g. *a display of the design of the study* <br> 
or *the article of a study you would like to reproduce*.

Then you should book an appointment (1/2 hour to 1 hour) in my
calender Monday afternoon (14h-17h) or Tuesday afternoon (14h-17h). I
only take one or two consultations like that a week so I may ask you to
postpone the meeting if I am too busy.

You can have a look at [this page](jekyll/update/2017/06/23/CheckingList.html), especially points 1-3 (Phase 1) and
1-3 (Phase 3) before the meeting, since it contains topics that I
almost always discuss during the consultations.

This type of consultation is refered as training and consultation in
the
[Guidelines for access to assistance with data analysis at NRU](jekyll/update/2017/06/23/GuidelineConsultNRU.html).

# Planning a study 

You are planning a new study or experiment. You have a clearly defined
objective, but you are wondering how to design the experiment so that
you have the appropriate data to answer your question(s) or test your
hypothesis(es). You should definitely seek assistance from a statistician! 
Unfortunately I have no experience in study design. You should use the 
Statistical advisory service at Rigshospitalet: see [here](http://biostat.ku.dk/statisticaladvisory/).

# Externalizing the statistical analysis

You would like to delegate the analysis of your data to a
statistician.  If your study is related to my research projects I will
be happy to help you (this is at my discretion). But be aware that in
most cases I won't be able to carry out this task due to lack of time.

You can also ask the Statistical advisory service at Rigshospitalet:
see [here](http://biostat.ku.dk/statisticaladvisory/). Again at their
discretion to accept or not. You can also ask other people from the
data analysis group at NRU.
