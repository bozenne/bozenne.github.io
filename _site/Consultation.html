    <p>This page is meant for the people from NRU (<a href="http://example.com/">https://nru.dk/</a>) needing
some assistance with data analysis. I do NOT help people outside NRU.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-help-you-with">What can I help you with?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical questions</strong>: <br /> You have a very specific question, it
could be a software question, e.g.  <em>which package to use in R for
fitting a linear mixed model?</em> or a statistical question, e.g.  <em>I
would like to compare the mean recovery across three treatment
groups, do you know a statistical test for doing that?</em> <br /> An
example of non-specific question is: <em>Can you check that my
statistical analysis is correct</em> (this is not specific because there
are many probably things to check).  A more appropriate question for
this format would be: <em>Looking at the qqplot of the residuals of my
model, do you think the normality assumption is reasonable?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Assistance for performing a statistical analysis</strong>: <br /> You would
like to perform a statistical analysis but would like a statistician
to supervise your work. It could also be that you would like to
perform a specific type of analysis (e.g. replicating what another
article previously did) but you need some help to carry it out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Planning a study</strong>: <br /> You are planning a new study or
experiment. You have one or few clearly defined hypotheses that you
would like to test but you are wondering how to appropriately design
your experiment / study to be able to carry out the tests. This is not
my domain of expertise in statistics but I can give you some feedback
and help you with simple power calculation. However do NOT come the
day before your grant deadline asking me for an “emergency” power
calculation!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Externalizing the statistical analysis</strong>: <br /> You want a
statistician to perform the statistical analysis for you. Don’t expect
much from me in this case, I will rarely accept to perform the
statistical analysis myself (this is at my discretion). If I accept
this would be because the statistical issues met in your study are
related to my research interests, nothing else.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-get-help">How to get help?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical questions</strong>: <br /> You don’t need to book a meeting, you
can just show at my office Monday afternoon (14h-17h) or Tuesday
afternoon (14h-17h) when I am available (check my calendar in
<a href="https://cal.nru.dk/">cal</a>). This type of consultation is typically
short, i.e. less than 15 minutes. If I am busy, you can also send me
an email (<a href="mailto:brice.ozenne@nru.dk">brice.ozenne@nru.dk</a>, please put <strong>Consultation</strong> in the
subject line) explaining your problem and I will try to answer
within a week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Assistance for performing a statistical analysis/Planning a
study</strong>: <br /> You should send me an email (brice.ozenne@nru.dk, please
put <strong>Consultation</strong> in the subject line). The email should include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a name for your project</li>
      <li>a short description of your study and your questions. By short I
mean it can be just two sentences.</li>
      <li>[optional] additional documents with a sentence explaining at
which part of the document I should look at (especially for articles).
e.g. <em>a display of the design of the study</em> <br /> or <em>the article of a
study that you would like to replicate</em>.
<br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then you can book an appointment (1/2 hour to 1 hour) in my calendar
Monday afternoon (13h30-17h00) or Tuesday afternoon (13h30-17h00). I
only take one or two consultations like that a week so I may ask you
to postpone the meeting if I am too busy.</p>

    <p>Note: sending me information by email may seem a loss of time, but
it will help me prepare the consultation and so we will be more
efficient when we will meet. In some cases it also forces you to
write down clearly what you are actually doing / wanting to do and
you may find by yourself the answers to your questions!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical questions</strong>: <br /> I will try my best to indicate the
appropriate the appropriate software/package/function/statistical
tool/criteria to use for solving your problem. Here I only try to
answer what you asked for. So I will assume that you have given me
all the necessary information and if information is missing I will
assume that you are in a standard case (e.g. normally distributed
outcomes, no missing values, …). In particular, I will (try to) not
assess whether what your doing seems reasonable to me and I am not
responsible for the validity of the statistical analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Assistance for performing a statistical analysis</strong> <br />
I can help you with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>performing statistical analysis that are suited to your research
question and that output interpretable quantities.</li>
      <li>generate nice figures (if you use the R software).</li>
      <li>write the “statistical analysis” paragraph from the method section
and help you to present the results in your manuscript.</li>
      <li>make sure that your analysis is reproducible, i.e. when you get
the review 3 months after you are able to reproduce the results
you got when you wrote the article (you need to ask specifically
for this).</li>
      <li>help you to answer the comments of the reviewers that are related
to the statistical analysis.
<br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>

    <p>What I will expect from you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to present me the person(s) involved in the project. By default I
will assume that you are the person in charge of the project. Also
tell me if there is another statistician involve because it make
sense that the statisticians agree before telling you what to do.</li>
      <li>to be responsible for organizing meeting, their frequency, and
choosing who should attend the meetings. Importantly, outside the
meeting I will never check whether you are making progress or need
help. So when you meet technical issues (with the software or what
the statistical method is about) it is often a good idea to look for
information on Internet and then to reach for help (me or one of
your colleague).</li>
      <li>to have a somewhat clear and fixed aim. If you have changed your
research question between two meetings you should explain it to
me. You can ask the same from me if I decide to change the
statistical approach.</li>
      <li>to keep track of the decision(s) we have taken during the
meeting. When the decisions are related to the manuscript you should
also write down the reason(s) for these decisions. It can seem
annoying to do but this will help us a lot first and foremost
because I will forget what has happened at the last meeting. It will
also help me to be consistent over time.</li>
      <li>to follow my recommendations: you are also welcome to disagree and
to propose alternative approach, for instance because they are more
classical in your fields. But at the end either we find an agreement
or I may withdraw from the project. If it was the case, it only
means that I don’t feel comfortable taking the responsibility for a
statistical analysis I disapprove, nothing more.</li>
      <li>before submitting an article with my name on it, you need to have
had my approval. Send me your article and I will give you some
comments. If I mention “major” or “major concerns” or something
along those lines this means that we need one more iteration (send
article, comments) before I approve it. Note that you’re very
welcome to disagree with my comments, then we should just meet to
discuss them. <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should not expect me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to be a policeman: you should not try things and then come to me
asking whether it correct or not.</li>
      <li>to be a magician: you should not expect statistics to create data
or more information than you have. If you only have data on 20
subjects don’t aim at testing 100 null hypotheses. Also be
realistic: doing statistics is not easy especially when it is not
your field of expertise. If you come with a complicated design,
missing values, and outcomes with non standard distributions, it
becomes less likely that (i) I can propose a statistical method
suited to your needs, (ii) this method is easy to apply, (iii) this
method is easy to interpret, (iv) it is the classical method used in
your field.</li>
      <li>to be a software tester: if you try to do the same analysis in
several software, you may end-up with different results. This is
annoying but you should not expect me to be able to say which
software is the best. I am personally working with the R software,
but I trust the classical software, e.g. SAS, SPSS, matlab ….</li>
      <li>to know all the statistical methods: sadly I have a limited
knowledge. So if you need to use a method with which I am not
familiar may need additional time to be able to help you.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="authorship">Authorship</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical questions</strong>: This help does not qualify me for co-authorship.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Assistance for performing a statistical analysis</strong>: This help
qualifies me for co-authorship. I expect it to be automatic. If
you/your superviser disagree we should discuss it at the first
meeting. My affiliations are:
    <ul>
      <li>Neurobiology Research Unit, Rigshospitalet and University of
Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark</li>
      <li>Department of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen,
Denmark  <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Planning a study</strong>: This help does not qualify me for co-authorship.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="response-time">Response time</h2>

<p>I usually answer to questions that I could not solve during the
consultation within a week. I you havn’t heared from after a week,
please send me a reminder, I have probably forgotten (sorry!).</p>

<p>If you ask me to review your article you should give me a delay of
two weeks.</p>

<p>What I cannot do is to help you to finish your analysis for
tomorrow. Please anticipate a resonable time for the statistical
analysis, especially if you have a complicated design or many
hypotheses to test.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I can provide you support in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to find
the appropriate function(s) to perform your analysis, display the
results, and understand the outputs of the software.</p>

<p>For other softwares (e.g. SAS, Stata, SPSS, GraphPad Prism, MATLAB,
Python, …), I can try to help you to understand the outputs of
software. Note that they are very skilled people in SAS at the section
of biostatistics so you should consider using Statistical advisory
service at Rigshospitalet (below) if you want to use SAS but you
anticipate you will need help to use it. People from the data analysis
group at NRU tend to use MATLAB and many psychologists at NRU use SPSS
so they can probably help you with these software.</p>

<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>

<p>Please tell me if there is any confidentiality clause relative to your
results or your data. By default, I will not share your data with
anybody without asking you. However I may discuss the analysis with
people at the section of biostatistics (not the results just the
method).</p>
