I am currently teaching in three Ph.D. courses for medical researchers at the University of Copenhagen (KU):
- [Epidemiological methods in medical research](https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/58764). This is a 10 day course over 3 months (January-March) where I am the course director in collaboration with the epidemiology section of KU. 
- [Statistical analysis of repeated measurements and clustered data](https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/47665). This is 6 day course over 3 weeks lead by Julie Forman, occuring every fall.
- [Basic Statistics](http://paulblanche.com/files/BasicStat2022.html). This is 10 day course over 6 weeks lead by Paul Blanche, occuring twice a year (spring/fall).

With Julie Forman, we have made a workshop on linear mixed models (LMMs) in 2022 for the method week at Karolinska Institutet:
- theoretical part about [LMMs](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2022-Workshop-LMMstar/KI2022-LMMstar-Part12.pdf) and their implementation in [LMMstar](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2022-Workshop-LMMstar/KI2022-LMMstar-Part3.pdf)
- practical part:  [single group](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2022-Workshop-LMMstar/gastricbypass.R), [two groups observational](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2022-Workshop-LMMstar/abeta.R), [two groups randomized](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2022-Workshop-LMMstar/ckd.R), [optimizer, statistical inference, predictions](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2022-Workshop-LMMstar/part3.R)

For the Brain drug project, I am also creating a workshop on Time-to-event analysis for registry data:
- theoretical part: [introduction](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2023-Workshop-Epi/prez-workshopEpi.pdf) in 2022.
- practical part: [introduction](https://bozenne.github.io/doc/Teaching/2023-Workshop-Epi/exercise-workshopEpi.R) in 2022.
