Mon research work is organized around three topics:
- the development of *latent variable models* for the analysis of
  complex data. I apply these developments on
  neuroimaging data and data from psychological tests to investigate
  the relationship between the brain response and depression.

\smallskip

- the analysis of registry data with *time to events outcomes* and
  *competing risks*. My developments have,
  for instance, been applied to compare preventive stroke treatments
  using the danish registry data.

\smallskip

- the development of *generalized pairwise comparisons* to handle
  multiple and heterogenous outcomes. A typical
  application is the assessment of new chemotherapy where being able
  to balance the benefit (longer in survival time) and the risk
  (treatment side effects) in an interpretable way is important.

I have some knowledge and interest in:

- **regression analysis**: a very convenient and flexible framework to
  analyze continous and categorical outcomes and their relationship
  with an exposure or clincal variables.

- **multiple testing issues**: who to perform an analysis that
  involves several outcomes or hypotheses to test while controling the
  type 1 error at 5%.

- **prediction and regularization methods**: I have read quite a lot
  on lasso regression recently. While I am far from being a specialist
  in machine learning, I have tested some of these methods (random
  forest, support vector machines, neural network) during my phd.

- **causal inference** ... peal

- **semi parametric theory** and **likelihood theory** books...
