I have some knowledge and interest in:

- **regression analysis**: a very convenient and flexible framework to
  analyze continous and categorical outcomes and their relationship
  with an exposure or clincal variables.

- **survival analysis**: what to do when analysing time to events
  (e.g. time to death, time to recovery)

- **multiple testing issues**: who to perform an analysis that
  involves several outcomes or hypotheses to test while controling the
  type 1 error at 5%.

- **prediction and regularization methods**: I have read quite a lot
  on lasso regression recently. While I am far from being a specialist
  in machine learning, I have tested some of these methods (random
  forest, support vector machines, neural network) during my phd.

I have also very basic notions in **causal inference**, **non
parametric methods** and **bayesian statistics**.
