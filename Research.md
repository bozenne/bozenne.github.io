As an applied statistician, my work mixes methodological development,
software development, and data analysis. By methodological development
I mean adapt or combine existing existing statistical results to solve
a statistical issue. So far, I have organized my research around three
topics:

- the development of models for repeated measurements and complex
  systems. This includes **latent variable models** and **linear mixed
  models**. I apply these developments on neuroimaging data and data
  from psychological tests to investigate the relationship between the
  brain response and depression.

- the analysis of registry data in presence of **right-censoring**,
  **competing risks**, and **counfounding**. The aim is to develop
  estimators that are robust (to model misspecification) and efficient
  based on the semi-parametric theory. My developments have, for
  instance, been applied to compare preventive stroke treatments using
  the danish registry data.

- the development of **generalized pairwise comparisons** to handle
  multiple and heterogenous outcomes. A typical
  application is the assessment of new chemotherapy where being able
  to balance the benefit (longer in survival time) and the risk
  (treatment side effects) in an interpretable way is important.

I have implemented these developments in the R packages
[lavaSearch2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaSearch2/index.html),
[LMMstar](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LMMstar/index.html),
[riskRegression](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/riskRegression/index.html),
and
[BuyseTest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BuyseTest/index.html).

I have been also been reading about:
- **Group sequential design** with *Group Sequential and Confirmatory
    Adaptive Designs in Clinical Trials* (Wassmer, 2006) and *Group
    Sequential Methods with Applications to Clinical Trials* (Jennison
    and Turnbull, 1999)
- **Causal inference** with *Causal Inference: What If* (Hernan,
  Robins, 2020), *Causal Inference in Statistics - A Primer*
  (Pearl, 2016), and *Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference*
  (Pearl, 2000)
- **Semi parametric theory** with *Semiparametric Theory and Missing
  Data* (Tsiatis, 2006)
- **Statistical inference**, especially multiple testing with *Multiple
    comparisons using R* (Bretz, 2011) and non-parametric tests with
    *Rank and Pseudo-Rank Procedures for Independent Observations in
    Factorial* (Brunner 2018)
- **Splines** with the excellent book *Generalized Additive Models: An
  Introduction with R* (Wood 2017)
- **Asymptotic theory** with *Asymptotic statistics* (van der Vaart,
  1998), *In all likelihood* (Pawitan, 2001), and *U-Statistics:
  theory and practice* (Lee, 1990). I have also read most of
  *High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint* (Wainwright., 2019) but would not claim to master the topic.
- **Epidemiology** with the classical reference *Statistical Methods
  in Epidemiology* (Clayton and Hills, 1993), a nice and
  concise book.
- **Time to event analysis** with the nice book *Dynamic Regression
  Models for Survival Data* (Martinussen and Scheike,
  2006).
- **Post-selection inference** with mostly papers like *Exact
  post-selection inference, with application to the lasso* (Lee et
  al., 2016) or *Optimal Inference After Model Selection* (Fithian et
  al., 2014)
- **Communication in science** with *Designing Science Presentations*
    (Carter, 2021)

I'm currently reading about:
- **Dynamic Treatment Regimes** with *Dynamic Treatment Regimes:
    Statistical Methods for Precision Medicine* (Tsiatis et al., 2019)
- **Survival analys** with *Survival and event history analysis: a
    process point of view* (Aalen, Borgan, and Gjessing, 2008) and
    *Counting processes and Survival analysis* (Fleming and
    Harrington, 2005)
