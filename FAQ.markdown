# Authorship

You don't need to add me as a co-author in a paper if you just came to
me for a technical questions. As soon as I provided a substantial
input for a paper in terms of analyses, interpretation of results, and
drafting of the paper, then coauthorship is only natural and
expected. See also the Vancouver
Protocol
[page 4](http://www.research.mq.edu.au/documents/policies/Vancouver.pdf).

# Response time 

I usually answer to questions that I could not solve during the
consultation within a week. I havn't answered after a week, please
send me a reminder, I have probably forgotten (sorry!).

If you ask me to review your article you should give me a delay of
two weeks.

What I cannot do is to help you to finish your analysis for
tomorrow. Please anticipate a resonable time for the statistical
analysis, especially if you have a complicated design or many
hypotheses to test.

# Software

I can provide you support in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to find
the appropriate function(s) to perform your analysis, display the
results, and understand the outputs of the software.

For other softwares (e.g. SAS, Stata, SPSS, GraphPad Prism, MATLAB,
Python, ...), I can try to help you to understand the outputs of
software. Note that they are very skilled people in SAS at the section
of biostatistics so you should consider using Statistical advisory
service at Rigshospitalet (see
[here](http://biostat.ku.dk/statisticaladvisory/)) if you want to use
SAS but you anticipate you will need help to use it. Note that many
psychologists use SPSS at NRU so they can probably help you with this
software.

# Confidentiality

Please tell me if there is any confidentiality clause relative to your
results or your data. By default, I will not share your data with
anybody without asking you. However I may discuss the analysis with
people at the section of biostatistics (not the results but the
method).
